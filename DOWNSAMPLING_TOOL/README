I created this "Download sampling shiny app" last year for this task. 
It takes as input the data created from the merged cell ranger output file "306-34SF.csv"
Upload this into the app
The user selects which library to be used for downsampling "select Gene Expression"
user selects which metric name for creating the Scaling Factor "select mean reads per cell"
user selects the start and end cols
user select the column to mutiple the scaling factor by "user select Number of Reads"

Download results "mean_reads_per_cell.xlsx"
