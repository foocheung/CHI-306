I developed the "Download Sampling Shiny App" for this assignment last year. 
The app requires input data generated from the merged cell ranger output file named "306-34SF.csv." 
Users need to upload this file to the app. 
Following that, they can choose the library for downsampling by selecting "Gene Expression," 
pick the metric name for creating the Scaling Factor (e.g., "mean reads per cell"), 
specify start and end columns, and choose the column to multiply the scaling factor by, 
which is done by selecting "Number of Reads." 
Finally, users can download the results in the "mean_reads_per_cell.xlsx" file.
